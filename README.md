# gh-simple-api

Implement [PEP 503][pep-0503] simple api with GitHub Page.

## Setup

1. You should **create your own repository** and choose this repo as the template. Select **include all branches**, so that you'll get `master`, `idx-pages` and `gh-pages` branch.
2. In repo's GitHub Page settings, switch GitHub Page source to `GitHub Action`.
3. You can customize your site by editing `gh-pages` branch just like other `JekyII` GitHub Pages.
4. Once you edit `idx-pages`(by calling the following workflows) or edit `gh-pages`, our build workflow will fetch built index htmls to `/simple` dir, then build your site from `gh-pages` source.

## Usage

### Action `hash-release`

`hash-release` will upload given files to GitHub Release. It outputs urls with `sha256` fragments.

<details>

<summary>Inputs, Outputs and Example</summary><br>

- Inputs:
  - tag: The release tag.
  - files: The files to upload.
  - repo: Upload to which repository, default as the caller repo.
- Outputs:
  - urls: urls point to uploaded files with hash attached to url fragments. Order is not guaranteed.

Upload files under `dist/` to Release of current repository:

```yaml
- uses: aioqzone/gh-simple-api/.github/actions/hash-release@master
  with:
    tag: 0.1.0
    files: dist/* # `dist` is not guaranteed to work!
```

  with:
    project: project1
    urls: https://example.com/package1-0.1.0-cp3-none.whl#sha256=111111 https://example.com/package1-0.1.0.tar.gz#sha256=2222222
